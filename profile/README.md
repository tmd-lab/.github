# Tribomechadynamics Laboratory

Welcome to the GitHub Group for the Tribomechadynamics Laboratory at Rice University, 
Department of Mechanical Engineering under the direction of Matthew R.W. Brake.



What is Tribomechadynamics? In short, itâ€™s a new field that has emerged from the 
confluence of structural dynamics, contact mechanics, and tribology. 
Central to these three fields is the study of interfaces; the difference comes 
in the length scale considered and the tools used to study an interface. Given a structure, 
such as an aeroturbine, the goal of Tribomechadynamics is to predict the response of the structure 
during the design stage (including the full nonlinear response), to predict the performance 
degradation over time, and to use models to optimize the design of the interfacial 
components (in terms of weight, properties, wear rates, etc.). Thus, the research in the 
Tribomechadynamics Lab spans length scales from nano to macro. For more information, visit [here](http://brake.rice.edu/).
